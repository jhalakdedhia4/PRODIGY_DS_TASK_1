# PRODIGY_DS_TASK_1 - Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.
Task-01 at Prodigy Infotech, where I explored the dynamic realm of data visualization.
In this task I used - Python in Jupyter Notebook, along with Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib with Seaborn for data visualization.
